            Dictionary of properly formatted subsetting parameters. An empty dictionary
            is passed as input here when subsetting is set to False in icesat2data methods.
        verbose : boolean, default False
            Print out all feedback available from the order process.
            Progress information is automatically printed regardless of the value of verbose.
        subset : boolean, default True
            Apply subsetting to the data order from the NSIDC, returning only data that meets the
            subset parameters. Spatial and temporal subsetting based on the input parameters happens
            by default when subset=True, but additional subsetting options are available.
            Spatial subsetting returns all data that are within the area of interest (but not complete
            granules. This eliminates false-positive granules returned by the metadata-level search)
        session : requests.session object
            A session object authenticating the user to order data using their Earthdata login information.
            The session object will automatically be passed from the icesat2data object if you
            have successfully logged in there.
        geom_filepath : string, default None
